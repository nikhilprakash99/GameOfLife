# GameOfLife
An efficient C++ implementation of Conway's Game of Life using SFML for visualization

## Description (TODO)

Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges (TODO)

On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge. 

## Visuals (TODO)

Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.
Installation

## Dependancies

The projects uses **Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML)** for handling graphics and animations. SFML is a fast and light weight library that has support for all popular operating systems (Windows, Linux and MacOS). For more details visit [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)

### Installation

For debian based systems

```bash
sudo apt install libsfml-dev
```

## Usage (TODO)

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
Support

## Roadmap (TODO)

 - [X] Configure Project and CMakeLists.txt
 - [X] SFML Installation
 - [ ] SFML Window Output
 - [ ] SFML GRID Output
 - [ ] Update README (https://www.makeareadme.com/#usage)
